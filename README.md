# PredictSalaries

This machine learning model is designed to forecast an individual's earnings based on their accumulated experience. 
It employs linear regression, a supervised learning technique, to establish a direct correlation between the influencing factor 
(years of experience) and the outcome variable (salary). The model is trained using a dataset containing salary data paired with corresponding years of experience. 
Its effectiveness is assessed using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared value. The objective is 
to develop a predictive model that can estimate salaries for new data instances not encountered during training. This model ultimately provides insights into the relationship
between experience and salary within the given context.
